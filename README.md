# Music-Library-Database-SQL-

This project was a music library database I created in SQL in order to keep tabs on songs I had in my collection.
The project was a final project for my Databases course at Simmons. 

Included here are .txt files that contain all the SQL code I used and a giant word doc that functions like a big read.me, 
explaining the whole database in detail.
